A simplified version of automated planning done in Amazon warehouses, this project focuses on an automated warehouse in which robots deliver products to picking stations to fulﬁll orders. A warehouse is represented as a rectangular grid, and the robots can move horizontally or vertically between adjacent cells. To fulﬁll given orders, robots have to carry shelves with the required products to matching picking stations. The robots are ﬂat, can move underneath shelves and pick them up. However, a robot that carries a shelf does not ﬁt under another shelf anymore, so that shelves may need to be moved out of the way ﬁrst. 

Challenge: The overall goal of the task is to fulﬁll all orders in as little time as possible, where time is counted in steps and each robot may (but does not have to) perform one action per time step. Your team will use the clingo program to find the plan to fulfill all orders. This is a dynamic world problem.

Objective: Demonstrate that our team can perform automated reasoning about actions using KR tools
